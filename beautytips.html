        "Drink plenty of water: Staying hydrated is key for maintaining healthy skin, hair and nails. Aim for 8-10 glasses of water per day.",
        "Cleanse your skin regularly: Cleaning your face twice a day helps remove dirt, oil and impurities. Use a gentle, non-drying cleanser suitable for your skin type.",
        "Exfoliate regularly: Exfoliating helps remove dead skin cells, leaving your skin looking brighter and smoother. Aim to exfoliate once or twice a week.",
        "Moisturize daily: Moisturizing helps keep skin soft, supple and hydrated. Use a moisturizer that is suitable for your skin type.",
        "Get enough sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Getting enough rest helps reduce dark circles and puffiness around your eyes.",

        "Avoid smoking: Smoking can cause premature aging and wrinkles. It can also damage your hair and nails.",
        "Use a face mask: Face masks can help hydrate, brighten or exfoliate your skin. Choose a mask that is suitable for your skin type and use it once or twice a week.",
        "Take care of your hair: Regular washing, conditioning and deep conditioning can help keep your hair healthy and shiny. Trim split ends regularly.",
        "Use heat protectants: When using hot styling tools like flat irons, curling irons or blow dryers, always use a heat protectant to prevent damage to your hair.",
        "Massage your scalp regularly: Massaging your scalp can improve circulation and promote healthy hair growth.",
        "Keep your nails healthy: Keep your nails trimmed, clean and moisturized. Avoid using harsh chemicals or acetone-based nail polish removers."
